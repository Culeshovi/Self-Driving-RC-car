# Self-Driving-RC-car
## Introduction
Self driving cars used to be a myth just a few years back but now thanks to deep learning it's a reality. The deep learning revolution has just started and it is taking over in all the major industries from health care to predicting stock prices. Companies like Tesla,Google,Baidu,Uber,Toyata,etc are have done significant work in the field of self driving cars. Nvidia provides the best hardware platform to make a self driving car.

The RC car in this project will be trained in a track. It can detect obstacle using ultrasonic sensor, it can sense stop sign and traffic light using computer vision and it's movements on the track will be controlled by a neural network.

## Components Required
* RC car chasis with motor and wheels
* Arduino UNO R3
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
* Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
* Jumper wires
